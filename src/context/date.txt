Thought process of the date counting algorithm
we pass in the relative days i.e the number of days the person has been alive in the current year starting 
from Jan 1
//birthdate has occured
case1(birthdate < currentdate):
this is meant to return the value of the currentdate - birthdate
we achieve this by subtracting the months starting from the the birthmonth till the month before the current month
e.g from Jan 1 to July 11 we have 191 days. We subtract starting from Jan till June
i.e 191-31 -28 -31 -30 -31 -30
        jan-feb-mar-apr-may-june
correctly giving us 10 days. The month increment subtracts 6 times giving 6 months in between

ps: since 2024 is a leap year. Feb is 29 not 28 hencing removing an extra 1 from the total. We fix this by
ofsetting that 1 at the final calculation i.e just check if feb == 29 and add it back

case2(birthdate > currentdate):
this time we start subtracting from the next month and not the current month(birthmonth)
e.g Jan 31 to July 11 is 161 days
161 -28 -31 -30 -31 -30
    feb-mar-apr-may-jun
correctly giving us 11days and subtracting 5 times to give us 5 months


case3(birthdate == currentdate):
exactly the same logic as case1

//birthmonth has not occured
case1(birthdate > currentdate):
